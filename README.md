# Project--HR-Department--Employee-Retention-

# Introduction <br>
The "HR Department - Employee Retention" project was undertaken with the primary objective of analyzing employee data to predict attrition and identify the underlying factors that contribute to employee turnover. High employee turnover can significantly disrupt organizational efficiency and lead to increased operational costs. By applying a combination of traditional statistical techniques and advanced machine learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), this project aims to equip HR departments with actionable insights to preemptively address attrition risks. The ultimate goal is to improve employee retention strategies, thereby fostering a more stable and satisfied workforce.<br>

## Project Overview:<br>
Employee retention remains one of the most pressing challenges faced by organizations globally. The departure of skilled employees not only results in the loss of invaluable knowledge and experience but also incurs substantial costs related to recruitment, training, and onboarding new hires. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence employee decisions to stay or leave is crucial for maintaining organizational health and ensuring long-term success.<br>
In this project, a rich dataset comprising various employee attributes was analyzed. The dataset included the following features:<br> 

## Tools and Techniques:<br>
***Programming Language***: Python<br>
***Libraries***: Pandas,Numpy,Scikit-Learn,Statsmodel,Matplotlib,Seaborn<br>
***Modeling Techniques***:Linear Regression,Random Forest Regressor,XgBoost Regressor,Logistic Regressoer, Decision Tree Model etc<br>
***Data sources***:Human_Resources.csv - Access Million<br>

# Data Processing and Methodology:<br>

The data processing phase involved meticulous data cleaning and preparation. Using pandas, the dataset was examined for inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. Categorical variables were encoded to ensure compatibility with machine learning models, and numerical variables were normalized to standardize the data range, thus improving model performance.<br>

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):<br>
A comprehensive EDA was conducted to explore correlations and trends within the data. Visualization tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib were employed to create insightful graphs and charts, revealing patterns that influence employee retention. For instance, correlations between job satisfaction, compensation, and attrition rates were analyzed in detail.<br>

# Feature Engineering:<br>
Key features were engineered to enhance the predictive power of the models. This involved creating interaction terms between variables such as "Years at Company" and "Job Level," and deriving new metrics such as "Employee Tenure" and "Promotion Rate."<br>

# Modeling and Implementation:<br>
The modeling phase involved the application of both traditional and advanced machine learning techniques.<br>

## Traditional Models:<br>
***Logistic Regression***:A baseline model used to predict the probability of attrition based on the input features. While simple, it provided valuable insights into the linear relationships between the variables.<br>
***Random Forest***: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy. It was particularly useful for understanding feature importance.<br>

## Deep Learning Models:<br>
***Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)***: Typically used for image data, CNNs were adapted for this structured data to capture complex patterns and interactions between features.<br>
***Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)***: A deep learning model with multiple layers that allowed for the capture of non-linear relationships in the data. The ANN was particularly effective in improving prediction accuracy for employee attrition.<br>

## Model Evaluation:<br>
The models were rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques were applied to ensure the robustness of the models, and hyperparameter tuning was performed to optimize model performance.<br>

## Model Interpretability:<br>
To ensure that the models are not black boxes, techniques such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) were used to interpret the models. This helped in understanding the contribution of each feature to the prediction, making the insights actionable for HR departments.<br>

## Conclusion:<br>
The "HR Department - Employee Retention" project successfully demonstrated the application of data science and machine learning to solve a critical business problem. By integrating both traditional and deep learning approaches, the project provided a comprehensive understanding of the factors driving employee attrition. The predictive models developed can serve as valuable tools for HR professionals, enabling them to proactively identify at-risk employees and implement strategies to retain top talent.
